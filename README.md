## Belly Button Biodiversity 

### Analysis Purpose

The analysis was designed to create a quick way for those performing the study to look into each volunteer participant to see if would have the needed bacteria's to study for the final product. 

To do this we needed to take the data supplied to us in the JSON format and build it into a dynamic webpage using HTML,CSS, D3 and javascript. We needed a way for someone to pull up the test subject number and see charts related to the top 10 bacteria, the cultures per sample, and the frequency of the test subjects washing frequency. We we also requested to customize 3 elements in the page to give it more visual flair.

We started with the demographics panel to give the users a way to select from a drop down and immediately see the critical test subject data.
